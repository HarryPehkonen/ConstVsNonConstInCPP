# C++ Const Performance Benchmarks

This project investigates performance implications of different `const` usage patterns in C++. Through precise benchmarking, we examine whether const member functions provide performance benefits, measure the impact of different const return strategies, and analyze caching patterns in const methods.

## What We're Testing

1. **Const vs Non-const Methods**
   ```cpp
   double heavyComputation();           // vs
   double heavyComputation() const;
   ```

2. **Const Member Variables with Caching**
   ```cpp
   // Regular const method
   double heavyComputation() const;     // vs
   
   // Const method with mutable cache
   mutable double cache_{0.0};
   double heavyComputationCached() const;
   ```

3. **Different Return Strategies**
   ```cpp
   const std::vector<double>& getData() const;     // const reference
   std::vector<double> getDataCopy() const;        // value copy
   const std::vector<double> getDataConstCopy() const;  // const value
   ```

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- CMake (3.10 or newer)
- Google Benchmark library
- C++17 compliant compiler

### Installing Google Benchmark
```bash
# On Debian/Ubuntu systems:
git clone https://github.com/google/benchmark.git
cd benchmark
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBENCHMARK_DOWNLOAD_DEPENDENCIES=on ..
make -j
sudo make install
```

### Building the Project
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Running Benchmarks
```bash
./const_benchmark
```

## Key Findings

1. **Const Methods**: The `const` qualifier itself doesn't typically provide performance benefits. It's a tool for correctness, not speed.
   ```cpp
   // These typically compile to identical code
   void process() const { ... }
   void process() { ... }
   ```

2. **Return Strategies**: 
   - Returning const references is significantly faster than returning by value
   - No significant performance difference between returning const and non-const values
   ```cpp
   // Prefer this (fast)
   const std::vector<double>& getData() const;
   
   // Over this (slower)
   std::vector<double> getData() const;
   ```

3. **Caching in Const Methods**: Using `mutable` for caching in const methods can provide significant performance benefits when appropriate.
   ```cpp
   class Example {
       mutable double cache_{0.0};
       double heavyComputation() const {
           if (cache_ == 0.0) {
               cache_ = /* expensive calculation */;
           }
           return cache_;
       }
   };
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Use const for Correctness**
   - Make member functions const when they don't modify object state
   - Use const references for parameters when you don't need to modify them
   - These choices are about preventing bugs, not about performance

2. **Return Strategy Guidelines**
   - Return by const reference for large objects when the lifetime is clear
   - Return by value for small objects (integers, small structs)
   - Use const return values only when you need to prevent modification

3. **Caching Strategy**
   - Use `mutable` for caching in const methods when:
     - The computation is expensive
     - The cached value is accessed frequently
     - The cache hit rate will be high
